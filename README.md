- Python implementations for Non-Reversible Parallel Tempering and Variational Parallel Tempering from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00080).
- Automatic schedule tuning in the variational algorithm from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02939).
- Chow-Liu algorithm for second-order product approximations of Gaussian tree dependence from [this paper](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/people/in_memoriam/roweis/csc2515-2006/readings/chowliu.pdf).
- Misc. papers
- Contribution: Variational Parallel Tempering algorithm with a Gaussian tree instead of a multivariate Gaussian as a reference, knocking $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$ for per-iteration cost of evaluating reference density.

(Note: Version control was initiated partway through; prior code was added in the initial commit.)
